					<p>The Citizen Rotation Office is a speculative design proposal by <a href="https://lukesturgeon.co.uk">Luke
							Sturgeon</a>. A fictional government service was designed to highlight the results of a technocratic
						policy designed with data.</p>

					<p>The everyday experience of the city is explored in-context, through immersive experience prototypes,
						combining mobile technologies, audio guides, digital props, improvisation actors, rented accommodation, food
						and transport services. The project involved multiple experiences that ranged from 45 minutes to 24 hours,
						placing participants within a possible future, created by extrapolating existing trends and applying online
						behaviours to the urban environment.</p>

					<p>If you are interested in future events, you can sign up to the project's mailing list for calls for
						particiation and news on upcoming installations.</p>
